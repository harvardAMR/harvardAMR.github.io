			<h2>Future plans</h2>
		</header>
		<p>Our work broadly falls under two areas: community engagement and political advocacy. As part of our community engagement efforts, we'll continue to
		host events for the Harvard and broader Boston AMR community with the goals of fostering increased collaboration across fields and providing trainees with more 
		opportunities to showcase their work. We plan to further expand our community engagement to include middle and high school students by running introductory workshops
		on infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance.
		
		Recognizing the importance of engaging our elected representatives on this critical issue, we're also planning to 1) write op-eds and 2) set up meetings with health
		staffers in congressional offices to advocate for increased government funding on AMR public health initiatives. To adequately address a problem of this scope will
		require a concerted and coordinated effort between policymakers, clinicians, scientists, and more, and we believe HAMR can play an important role in jumpstarting these
		discussions.</p>

	<h3>November 1st, 2018: Fall AMR Symposium</h3>
		<p>
			<span class="image left"><img src="assets/images/bact6.jpg" alt="" /></span>
			HAMR was awarded a Harvard Integrated Life Sciences grant to host an interdisciplinary symposium 
			on antimicrobial resistance. We heard fantastic talks from trainees and faculty working on areas 
			ranging from drug development to population-wide epidemiology. Thanks to all the speakers and attendees 
			for a successful event!

			HAMR hosted Dr. Michael Gilmore, Principal Investigator of the Harvard-wide Program
