<h2 id="content">Introduction</h2>
<p>The development of effective antibiotic therapy has likely prevented tens of millions of 
infection-related deaths, but the evolution and spread of multidrug-resistant pathogens 
critically threatens the status quo. The population-wide projected impact of antimicrobial resistance has 
been estimated to entail considerable increases in both the morbidity and mortality of infectious diseases, resulting moreover in 
dramatic increases in healthcare spending. The Harvard Antimicrobial Resistance (HAMR) GSAS Network 
was founded to bring together the broader Harvard community to address this pressing challenge on all fronts, from 
understanding the basic science of resistance to studying economic interventions for incentivizing drug development. Our work falls broadly under two areas: community engagement and political advocacy.</p>

		<h3>Community engagement</h3>
		<p>As part of our community engagement efforts, we'll continue to
		host events for the Harvard and broader Boston AMR community with the goals of fostering increased collaboration across fields and providing trainees with more 
		opportunities to showcase their work. We plan to further expand our community engagement to include middle and high school students by running introductory workshops
		on infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance.</p>

		<h3>Political advocacy</h3>
		<p>Recognizing the importance of engaging our elected representatives on this critical issue, we're also planning to 1) write op-eds and 2) set up meetings with health
		staffers in congressional offices to advocate for increased government funding on AMR public health initiatives. To adequately address a problem of this scope will
		require a concerted and coordinated effort between policymakers, clinicians, scientists, and more, and we believe HAMR can play an important role in jumpstarting these
		discussions.</p>
