			Why can't we use common antibiotics to treat tuberculosis, the deadliest infectious disease in human history? Francesca is deeply fascinated by this question, and her work in Eric Rubin's lab at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health focuses on understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying Mycobacterium tuberculosis's intrinsic resistance to antibiotics. She hopes to apply this work towards developing creative new ways to treat TB, and other infectious diseases that are recalcitrant to antibiotic therapy. When not running gels, Francesca can be found running through the streets of Boston, or playing with her beloved cat Charlotte.
