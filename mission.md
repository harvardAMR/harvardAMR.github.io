<h2 id="content">Introduction</h2>
<p>The development of antibiotic therapy has prevented tens of millions of 
infection-related deaths, but the evolution of multidrug-resistant pathogens threatens the status quo. 
The projected impacts of antimicrobial resistance are dramatic increases in both the morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs of infectious diseases. 
Harvard Antimicrobial Resistance (HAMR) @ GSAS 
was founded to bring together the broader Harvard community to address this pressing challenge on all fronts, from 
understanding the basic science of resistance to studying economic interventions for incentivizing drug development. Our work falls broadly under two areas: community engagement and political advocacy.

		<h3>Community engagement</h3>
		<p>As part of our community engagement efforts, we host events for the Harvard and broader Boston AMR community with the goals of fostering increased collaboration across disparate fields and providing trainees with more 
		opportunities to showcase their work. We aim to highlight perspectives not typically encountered in the academic biomedical community including experts from law, economics, pharmacy, activism, and beyond. We plan to further expand our community engagement to include middle and high school students by running introductory workshops
		on infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance.</p>

		<h3>Political advocacy</h3>
		<p>Recognizing the importance of engaging our elected representatives on AMR, we are also planning to 1) write op-eds and 2) set up meetings with health
		staffers in congressional offices to advocate for increased government funding on AMR public health initiatives. Despite growing recognition of the importance 
		of an early response to concerning trends in the prevalence of AMR, funding for sustainable antibiotic development and public health surveillance have remained below ideal levels.</p>
