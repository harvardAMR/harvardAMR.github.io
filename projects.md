			<h2>Overview</h2>

		<p>Our work broadly falls under two areas: community engagement and political advocacy. In the Fall 2019 semester, we are currently organizing additional talks, drafting an Op-Ed on AMR, and expanding our team to include new students and postdoctoral affiliates.</p>

	<h3>November 4th 2019, 4-6PM: Career / Policy Chat with Kevin Outterson</h3>
		<p>
			<span class="image right"><img src="assets/images/carbx.jpg" alt="" /></span>
			Harvard AMR, IDC, and GPIB hosted a policy / career chat with Dr. Kevin Outterson, executive director of CARB-X, a non-profit antibacterial R&D partnership, and co-director of the health law program at BU. 
			We heard from Dr. Outterson on CARB-X's unique approach to address the pressing challenges of AMR and then delved into a broader discussion on similarities and differences compared to climate change science / advocacy, the role of "low-tech" versus "high-tech" solutions, and better public engagement on AMR.
